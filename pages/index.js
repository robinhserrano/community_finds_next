            When you use Community Finds, you join a community of people from
            Barangay Balibago who can post their lost or found properties within
            the area. Non-residents of the barangay who are certain to have lost
            their property within the area, may utilize the Community Finds by
            uploading the details of the lost property and other helpful
            information to help them find the lost item.
            <br /> <br />
            The online platform provides the residents and non-residents a
            better chance of finding their lost properties. Community Finds is
            also a place to provide inspiration and motivation for others to
            post their found property and to return it to the rightful owner.
